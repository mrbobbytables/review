"""The container's half of the optional lab broker (#379).

The lab is a maintainer's own Kubernetes cluster, and this appliance owns no
lab and depends on none. What the launcher hands the container is therefore
not a credential, a cluster configuration file, or a host binary: it is one
private Unix socket whose other end runs on the host, holds all of that, and
answers exactly three typed questions — ``status``, ``health``, and
``submit``.

Everything here is failure-shaped on purpose. A missing socket, a broker that
died, a timeout, a truncated answer, a protocol error: every one of them
comes back as ``DEGRADED`` with a reason. None of them comes back looking
like a successful empty answer, because a clean-looking empty answer is how a
review silently loses its evidence and reports something it never checked.
