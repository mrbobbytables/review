# Factory Operations

## When to Use

Use this when coordinating multiple bounded changes or deciding whether work
should continue after a worker, check, review, or remote operation changes
state.

## Operating Rules

- The default state is continue. Worker completion is an event, not supervisor
  completion.
- An initial issue list is a minimum path unless explicitly exhaustive. After
  a core-path or milestone merge, refresh the full repository issue, pull
  request, ownership, and dependency graph; admit the highest-priority ready
  work that does not conflict, and park only for a concrete dependency, human
  design decision, unavailable acceptance environment, or active overlapping
  owner.
- Assign one sole writer to each branch or worktree and state its explicit
  write set. Waiting, CI, review, and remote work do not consume writable
  capacity.
- An exact candidate SHA binds focused verification, hosted CI, and independent
  review. Evidence from a superseded SHA is stale.
- Blockers are lane-local: park only that lane and record discovered
  dependencies. Refill writable capacity immediately with the highest-priority
  ready work that does not conflict.
- Three writers is a ceiling, not a utilization target. Never invent filler
  work.
- Put important transition receipts in the repository's durable issue or pull
  request system.
- Before merge, classify the candidate against its owning issue as a full
  outcome or partial slice: a full outcome uses a closing keyword in the pull
  request and, after merge, verifies that the owning issue is actually
  closed/completed in the durable repository tracker; a partial slice uses
  non-closing `Progresses` or an equivalent and leaves unresolved intent open;
  an external or human blocker remains open with concrete blocker evidence.
  After every merge, blocker, or ownership transition, reconcile the current factory or
  ledger projection against live issue and pull-request state before selecting
  the next READY work; durable ledger/status must never contradict the
  repository tracker.
- When an authorized repository owner explicitly clears a lane and current
  remote PR, branch, and assignee evidence is clean, an unpushed planning
  reference is advisory rather than ACTIVE ownership; record the clearance and
  dispatch. Actual overlapping maintainer branches or PRs take precedence.
- Repair concrete, validated failures without speculative re-architecture.
- Knowing the next steps is not a stop condition. Continue until the outcome
  is merged or concretely externally blocked.

## Delivery Cadence

Review is fast-moving, and cadence is part of correctness here.

- Batch every compatible, ready fix into one integrated branch and one pull
  request. A staged sequence of micro-batches buys nothing a single reviewable
  diff does not, and each stage costs a full review round trip.
- Parallelize read-only work — research, exploration, and review passes. It
  shares no state and cannot conflict, so it never needs a lane.
- Do not add process overhead that produces no evidence: no staged approval
  gates between compatible changes, no intermediate PRs opened to be closed.
- Cadence never buys out a correctness gate. Batched work still passes the
  repository's full validation, every change still carries its evidence, and
  the sole-writer boundaries hold: one writer per branch or worktree, one
  agent per landing batch, and Hive as the only assignment authority.
  Parallelism belongs to reading; writing stays single-writer.

When an unexpected blocker pauses continuation, record the concrete reason in
the relevant tracker; park only the affected lane; never invent an uncommitted
session diary.
